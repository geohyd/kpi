// TODO: this is our current pallete of colors
// we neeed to clean this up and merge/cut out some colors

/*
  Group 1: Blueish grays

  NOTE: KPI uses "$black" as default text color and all gray elements of UI are
  derived from this color for better match (hue and saturation is shared).

  I tried moving all different shades of hues in grays I've found in code to
  this list, either megring into existing colors or creating new ones.

  There are too many shades of gray here. We need to merge them further and cut
  down the list at least to less than 10 colors.
