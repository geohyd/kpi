    Spoiler: Kludgy!

    The purpose of this model is only to provide an obvious name for
    the superuser section in Django Admin.
    Django needs a model to register an admin model, so it extends a shadow
    model (as a proxy) to avoid creating new migrations.
    It extends `KobocatMonthlyXFormSubmissionCounter` but it could have
    been anyone of the (shadow) models since we do not add/update/delete objects
    from the admin interface. The HTML template only lists the available reports.
